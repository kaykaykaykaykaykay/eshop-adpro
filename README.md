Reflection 1

Thus far I believe that I have implemented basic CRUD functionality for the Product entity using the Spring Boot MVC architecture.

A few clean code principles that I applied are consistent naming of classes, methods, and model attributes improved clarity and reduced errors making the code easy to read and maintain.
Secure coding practice wise, data access is restricted to the repository layer and product IDs are generated on the server side using UUIDs instead of user input, helping prevent data manipulation and ensuring safer request handling.

The problems that I've encountered while doing this module is that I am still learning the entire Spring Boot architecture. Hence there was a lot of trail and errors.
